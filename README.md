# PCB Business Card Project

This project aims to create a unique PCB business card using a NFC technology.

## Features
- Slim and compact design
- LED lighting effects
- QR code integration for digital contact information

## Getting Started
To assemble the PCB business card, you will need the following components:
- Printed circuit board (included in the repository)
- Soldering iron and solder
- LEDs
- NT3H1101 -https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/302/NT3H1101_1201-1127167.pdf
- Resistors
- Capacitor

To assemble:
1. Solder the components onto the PCB following the provided schematic.

## Usage
Once assembled, the PCB business card can be used to share contact information in a unique and memorable way. Simply hand it to someone, and they can scan the QR code to save your contact details digitally.

##
Its hardware is not yet ready. Once we get the PCB after fabrication then we can write any Link to its NFC Chip using Mobile (NFC enabled).
